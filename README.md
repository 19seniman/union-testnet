## DESCRIPTIONS

Union is a highly efficient interoperability layer based on Zero-Knowledge, designed for general message communication, cross-chain asset transfers, NFTs, and DeFi. Union utilizes Zero-Knowledge cryptography and BLS signatures to create a secure and fast inter-blockchain communication protocol (IBC). Currently, the Union testnet is live and offers developers and users a platform to test the features and functionality of the protocol. This script is designed to automate transactions on the Sepolia - Holesky and Sepolia - Babylon networks, as well as other features.
